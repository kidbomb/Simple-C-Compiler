So, what is Simple C compiler?

The Simple C compiler is a compiler for Neander/Ramses/Ahmes. This compiler takes for input
a Simple C file and returns an assembly file according to the given processor.

What is Simple C?
Simple C is how I'm calling in this project a C with a (very) reduced set of instructions. I will create a document explaining all those instructions.

Final warning: this project IS NOT MEANT to replace any technique learned on class. This project was created with an one and only purpose for me to understand how a compiler toolchain works. If you are using this tools instead of your own skills, please stop NOW. If github could allow me to keep this repository private FOR FREE, I would do it.
