This repository is a collection of tools for the Neander machine

 * PyNeander: a Neander implementation in Python;
 * NeanderSharp: a Neander implementation in C#;
 * Neander4iPhone: an incomplete Neander implementation in Objective C
 * sc2tac, tac2asm, asm2mem: a toolchain to generate Neader bytecode using a stripped down version of C. Very far from complete, not being maintanend anymore, and highly experimental. Using it for any college assignments is highly discouraged.
